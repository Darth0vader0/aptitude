Concept:

Alligation and Mixture is a concept used to determine the ratio in which two or 
more ingredients at different prices must be mixed to produce a mixture at a
desired price. It's essentially a variation of the concept of averages.

Key Terms:

Mixture: The combination of two or more ingredients.
Ingredient: A single item being mixed.
Mean Price: The average price of the mixture.
Cost Price: The price of a single unit of an ingredient.

Formulas:

There are two main rules in Alligation:

1. Alligation Rule: This is often represented visually using a diagram

Ingredient 1 (Cost Price 1)      Ingredient 2 (Cost Price 2)
                         \       /
                           Mean Price
                         /       \
    (Mean Price - Cost Price 2)  (Cost Price 1 - Mean Price)  

The ratio in which the ingredients should be mixed
 is (Mean Price - Cost Price 2) : (Cost Price 1 - Mean Price).

Important Note: This rule works when one ingredient is 
cheaper than the mean price and the other is more expensive.


2. Mixture Rule (for finding the quantity of an ingredient):

if you know the quantities of some ingredients and the desired mean price, you can find the quantity of the missing ingredient:

Let x be the quantity of ingredient 1, y be the quantity of ingredient 2, and so on.
Let p1, p2, ... be their respective cost prices.
Let pm be the desired mean price of the mixture.
Then, the total cost of the mixture equals the sum of the costs of individual ingredients:

(x * p1) + (y * p2) + ... = (x + y + ...) * pm

Example 1 (Alligation Rule):

In what ratio must rice at ₹9.30 per kg be mixed with rice at ₹10.80 per kg so that the mixture is worth ₹10 per kg?

Cost Price 1 (cheaper rice) = ₹9.30
Cost Price 2 (more expensive rice) = ₹10.80
Mean Price = ₹10
Applying the alligation rule:

9.30                     10.80
     \                 /
             10
     /                 \
(10 - 10.80) = 0.80     (9.30 - 10) = 0.70 

Ratio = 0.80 : 0.70 = 8 : 7

Therefore, the rice must be mixed in the ratio 8:7.

Example 2 (Mixture Rule):

A merchant has 50 kg of wheat, part of which he sells at 10% profit and the rest at 5% loss. 
If he has a 7% profit on the whole, how much was sold at 10% profit?

Let x be the quantity sold at 10% profit, and (50 - x) be the quantity sold at 5% loss.

Effective selling price per kg (7% profit) = 1 + 0.07 = 1.07 times the cost price. 
We can assume the cost price per kg is 1 for simplicity since we are only interested in 
the ratio.
Setting up the equation:

1.10 * x + 0.95 * (50 - x) = 1.07 * 50

1.10x + 47.5 - 0.95x = 53.5
0.15x = 6
x = 40

Therefore, the quantity sold at 10% profit is 4
So, 40 kg of wheat was sold at a 10% profit.
