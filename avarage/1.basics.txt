Averages – Basic Concepts and Formulas
=======================================

1. Definition:
--------------
The **average** (arithmetic mean) of a group of numbers is the **sum of the numbers divided by the number of elements**.

   ➤ Average = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

2. Key Formulas:
----------------

- **Average of n numbers**:  
  = (a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₙ) / n

- **Sum = Average × Number of terms**

- If a person joins or leaves a group and the average changes:
  ➤ Total change in sum = Change in average × New number of terms

3. Important Cases:
-------------------

- **Average of first n natural numbers** = (n + 1) / 2

- **Average of first n even numbers** = (n + 1)

- **Average of first n odd numbers** = n

- **If the same number x is added to each term**,  
  ➤ New Average = Old Average + x

- **If the same number x is subtracted from each term**,  
  ➤ New Average = Old Average - x

4. Weighted Average:
--------------------

When different groups have different sizes and averages:

➤ Weighted Average =  
  (n₁ × avg₁ + n₂ × avg₂ + ... + nₖ × avgₖ) / (n₁ + n₂ + ... + nₖ)

Example: If class A (avg = 60, size = 30) and class B (avg = 70, size = 20),  
Overall average = (60×30 + 70×20) / (30 + 20)

5. Shortcut:
------------

When replacing one person in a group and the average changes:

➤ New person’s value = Old person’s value ± (change × group size)

6. Typical Question Patterns:
-----------------------------

- Find the average of a set of numbers
- Find the missing number given average and others
- Change in average after adding/removing person/item
- Questions involving cricket scores, team averages, marks, runs, etc.
- Comparing averages between groups (weighted average problems)
