basic formula 
    If A invests ₹A for T₁ months and B invests ₹B for T₂ months:
    A's Share : B's Share = (A × T₁) : (B × T₂)

    profit calculation
    A's share = [A × T₁ / (A × T₁ + B × T₂)] × P
    B's share = [B × T₂ / (A × T₁ + B × T₂)] × P

    example: Suppose A invests ₹5000 for 12 months and B invests ₹3000 for 8 months. The total profit (P) is ₹4600.
    A's share : B's share = (5000 × 12) : (3000 × 8)
                   = 60000 : 24000
                   = 5 : 2

    A's share = [5 / (5 + 2)] × 4600 = (5/7) × 4600 ≈ ₹3285.71

    B's share = [2 / (5 + 2)] × 4600 = (2/7) × 4600 ≈ ₹1314.29

steps to calculate profit share:

1. Write down each partner's investment and the time (in months) for which they invested.
2. Multiply each partner's investment by the number of months they invested to get their "capital-months".
3. Find the ratio of the partners' capital-months.
4. Add the ratio parts to get the total number of parts.
5. Divide the total profit in the same ratio as the capital-months.
6. Each partner's share = (Their ratio part / Total parts) × Total profit.

Example:
A invests ₹5000 for 12 months, B invests ₹3000 for 8 months, profit = ₹4600.

Step 1: A = 5000, 12 months; B = 3000, 8 months
Step 2: A's capital-months = 5000 × 12 = 60000; B's capital-months = 3000 × 8 = 24000
Step 3: Ratio = 60000 : 24000 = 5 : 2
Step 4: Total parts = 5 + 2 = 7
Step 5: A's share = (5/7) × 4600 = ₹3285.71; B's share = (2/7) × 4600 = ₹1314.29
