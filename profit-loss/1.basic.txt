1. Basic Terms & Formulas
Cost Price (CP)

Selling Price (SP)

Profit = SP − CP

Loss = CP − SP

Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100

Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100

2. Successive Profit & Loss
When two gains/losses happen one after another.

Formula:

Net % = A + B + (AB/100)
(Gain as +, Loss as −)

3. Discounts
Single Discount

Multiple/Successive Discounts

Equivalent Discount concept

Marked Price, Selling Price after Discount

4. Marked Price (List Price)
How profit/loss is calculated when item is sold at discount but above/below CP.

5. False Weights
Seller uses less weight than promised (e.g., sells 950g instead of 1kg but charges full price).


    I. If a trader professes to sell his goods at cost price, but uses false weights, then

        Gain % = [ Error / (True Value – Error) × 100 ] %

    II. If a trader professes to sell his goods at a profit of x% but uses false weight which is y% less than the actual weight, then

        Gain % = [ (x + y) / (100 – y) × 100 ] %

    III. If a trader professes to sell his goods at a loss of x% but uses false weight which is y% less than the actual weight, then

        Gain or Loss % = [ (y – x) / (100 – y) × 100 ] %

    (Note: Final result sign depends on the expression — gain if positive, loss if negative.)

Used in tricky placement Qs.

6. Overall Gain or Loss in Multiple Transactions
Different profit/loss on multiple parts (e.g., 2/3 sold at 20% gain, rest at 10% loss)

7. Buying & Selling Multiple Articles
e.g., Bought 12 for ₹10, sold 10 for ₹12 — find gain or loss

8. Profit & Loss on SP Instead of CP
% is given on SP instead of CP — this reverses formulas:

CP = (100 / (100 + gain%)) × SP
CP = (100 / (100 − loss%)) × SP

9. Investment Based (Partnership-style Profit Problems)
Not always in this topic, but companies sometimes mix profit-sharing logic.

10. Price Change Affecting Profit %
If CP or SP changes by a %, what happens to profit?
