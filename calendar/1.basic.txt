ðŸ“…  CALENDAR SHORTCUT NOTES ðŸ“…

-------------------------------------
âœ… BASIC DAY-FINDING SHORTCUT
-------------------------------------
If today is a certain day and you want to know what day it will be after X days:

1. Do: X % 7 â†’ gives remainder R
2. Move forward R days from the current day

Example:
If today is Monday and X = 10,
â†’ 10 % 7 = 3 â†’ Monday + 3 = Thursday

To go backwards, use: (-X) % 7 and move back.

âœ… 15 AUGUST 1947 â€“ WHAT DAY WAS IT?
-------------------------------------
Your custom trick:

1. Find last completed 400-multiple before the year:
   1946 â†’ last is 1600 â†’ 0 odd days

2. Remaining years = 346
   â†’ 300 = 1 odd day (from this table):
      100 â†’ 5
      200 â†’ 3
      300 â†’ 1
      400 â†’ 0

3. Remaining 46 years = 
   - Leap years = 11 â†’ 11Ã—2 = 22
   - Ordinary years = 35 â†’ 35Ã—1 = 35
   - Total = 22 + 35 = 57 + 1 (from 300 years) = 58 odd days

4. Month + Date odd days:
   Jan = 3
   Feb = 0
   Mar = 3
   Apr = 2
   May = 3
   Jun = 2
   Jul = 3
   Aug = 15 â†’ 15 Ã· 7 = 2 remainder 1
   â†’ Total = 17

5. Total = 58 (year) + 17 (month+date) = 75
   75 % 7 = 5 â†’ **Friday**

âœ… Final Answer: 15th August 1947 was a **Friday**

-------------------------------------
âœ… SAME CALENDAR YEAR SHORTCUT
-------------------------------------
Use this based on year % 4:

| year % 4 | Add this many years |
|----------|----------------------|
|   0      | 28                   |
|   1      | 6                    |
|   2      | 11                   |
|   3      | 11                   |

Example:
2003 % 4 = 3 â†’ add 11 â†’ 2003 + 11 = **2014**

âœ… So, 2014 has the **same calendar** as 2003

More examples:
- 2004 â†’ 2004 % 4 = 0 â†’ +28 â†’ 2032
- 2007 â†’ 2007 % 4 = 3 â†’ +11 â†’ 2018

âœ… DAY CODES (for remainder â†’ weekday)
-------------------------------------
0 = Sunday  
1 = Monday  
2 = Tuesday  
3 = Wednesday  
4 = Thursday  
5 = Friday  
6 = Saturday
