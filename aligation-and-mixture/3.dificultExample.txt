17. Varying Removal and Addition in a Mixture: A tank contains a mixture of milk and water in the ratio 3:2. 20 liters of the mixture are removed, and then 10 liters of milk and 10 liters of water are added. If the new ratio is 4:3, find the original quantity of the mixture.

18. Mixture of Solutions with Different Concentrations and Replacements: You have 100 ml of a solution that is 80% acid. You remove 20 ml and replace it with a solution that is 50% acid. Then, you remove 30 ml of the new mixture and replace it with a solution that is 20% acid. What is the approximate acid concentration in the final solution?

19. Finding Original Quantities from Multiple Replacements: A container initially has 'x' liters of liquid A. 'y' liters are removed and replaced with liquid B. This process is repeated 'n' times. If the final quantity of liquid A is 'z' liters, derive a formula for the initial quantity 'x' in terms of y, z, and n. Apply this formula to the case where z = 16, y = 8, and n = 2.

Final Answer: 100 liters
Final Answer: 53.3% (approx)
Final Answer: Formula: x = z / ((x-y)/x)^n which simplifies to x = z * (x/(x-y))^n. For the given values (z=16, y=8, n=2), if we interpret the formula as z = x * ((x-y)/x)^n, then 16 = x * ((x-8)/x)^2. Solving this gives x = 32 liters.
Final Answer: This requires solving a system of linear equations. One possible solution (ratios can be scaled) is p:q:r = 4:1:6 (or any multiple).
