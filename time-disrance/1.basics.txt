Time, Speed, and Distance - Basics
===============================

1. Basic Formula:
   Distance = Speed × Time
   Speed = Distance / Time
   Time = Distance / Speed

2. Units of Speed:
   - km/hr to m/s: Multiply by 5/18
   - m/s to km/hr: Multiply by 18/5

3. Relative Speed:
   - Same direction: Subtract speeds
   - Opposite direction: Add speeds

4. Average Speed:
   - If equal distance covered at two different speeds:
     Avg Speed = (2 × x × y) / (x + y)
     where x and y are the two speeds.

5. Train Problems:
   - Time to cross a pole = Length of train / Speed
   - Time to cross a platform = (Length of train + Length of platform) / Speed
   - Two trains crossing each other (same/opposite direction) use relative speed.

6. Boat and Stream:
   - Speed downstream = Boat speed + Stream speed
   - Speed upstream = Boat speed - Stream speed
   - Time = Distance / Effective speed

7. Chase Problems:
   - Time to catch = Lead / Relative speed

8. Meeting Point:
   - If two objects move toward each other:
     Time = Distance between them / (Speed of A + Speed of B)

9. Circular Track:
   - Time to meet = Circumference / Relative speed

10. General Tips:
   - Always keep units consistent (convert minutes to hours, meters to km if needed)
   - Be careful with direction: for relative speed, direction matters
   - Speed and time are inversely proportional when distance is constant
