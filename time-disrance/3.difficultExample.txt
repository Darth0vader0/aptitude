Time, Speed and Distance â€“ 20 Difficult Problems
===============================================

1. A train 500m long crosses a platform in 36 seconds and a man in 20 seconds. Find the length of the platform.

2. Two trains of lengths 240 m and 360 m run on parallel tracks in the same direction. The faster train overtakes the slower in 72 seconds. If the speed of the slower train is 45 km/hr, find the speed of the faster train.

3. A man can row 12 km downstream in 3 hours and the same distance upstream in 4 hours. Find the speed of the stream and the speed of the boat in still water.

4. A train crosses a 600 m bridge in 30 seconds and a pole in 18 seconds. Find the speed of the train and its length.

5. A car travels from A to B at 60 km/hr and returns at 40 km/hr. If the total time taken is 10 hours, find the distance between A and B.

6. Two trains running in opposite directions cross a man standing on the platform in 27 seconds and 17 seconds respectively. If the length of the first train is 270 meters, find the length of the second train.

7. A train running at 90 km/hr crosses another train running at 60 km/hr in 36 seconds in the opposite direction. If the length of the first train is 200 m, find the length of the second train.

8. A boat covers 30 km downstream in 2 hours and returns upstream in 5 hours. Find the speed of the boat and the speed of the stream.

9. A train 200 meters long passes a man running at 10 km/hr in the same direction in 10 seconds. Find the speed of the train in km/hr.

10. A 150 m long train passes another 150 m long train in opposite direction in 12 seconds. Find the speed of each train if they are equal.

11. A cyclist starts 30 minutes after a car that travels at 60 km/hr. He rides at 75 km/hr. After how long will he catch the car?

12. A man covers 1/3 of a journey at 30 km/hr, the next 1/3 at 60 km/hr, and the last 1/3 at 90 km/hr. Find his average speed for the whole journey.

13. A man walking at 5 km/hr is overtaken by a car traveling in the same direction. The car passes him in 10 seconds. If the car is 50 m long, find its speed.

14. A train running at 108 km/hr takes 15 seconds to cross another train of 180 m running in opposite direction. Find the length of the first train.

15. A man leaves point A at 7:00 AM and walks toward B at 5 km/hr. Another man leaves B at 8:30 AM and walks toward A at 7 km/hr. If the distance between A and B is 54 km, at what time will they meet?

16. Two trains of equal lengths running in opposite directions cross each other in 10 seconds. They take 60 and 90 seconds respectively to cross a platform. Find the length of each train.

17. A train takes 20 seconds to pass a 140 m long platform and 12 seconds to pass a man. Find the length of the train.

18. A train overtakes two persons walking in the same direction at 6 km/hr and 10 km/hr in 18 and 24 seconds respectively. Find the speed of the train.

19. A car covers a certain distance at 60 km/hr. If the speed were increased by 10 km/hr, it would have taken 48 minutes less. Find the distance.

20. Two stations are 480 km apart. A train starts from each station toward each other at the same time. They meet after 4 hours. If one train is 20 km/hr faster than the other, find their speeds.
