Boats and Streams – Concept, Formulas & Examples

----------------------------
KEY TERMS
----------------------------
1. Speed of Boat in Still Water (u):
   - The speed of the boat when there is no stream.

2. Speed of Stream or Current (v):
   - The speed at which water flows.

3. Downstream Speed (Ds):
   - When boat moves in the same direction as the stream.
   - Formula: Ds = u + v

4. Upstream Speed (Us):
   - When boat moves opposite to the stream.
   - Formula: Us = u - v

----------------------------
DERIVED FORMULAS
----------------------------
If downstream and upstream speeds are known:

Speed of boat in still water (u) = (Ds + Us) / 2  
Speed of stream (v) = (Ds - Us) / 2

----------------------------
BASIC RELATION
----------------------------
Distance = Speed × Time  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Speed = Distance / Time

----------------------------
EXAMPLE 1
----------------------------
A boat’s speed in still water is 10 km/hr, and the stream flows at 2 km/hr.
(a) What is the downstream speed?
(b) What is the upstream speed?
(c) Time to travel 36 km downstream?
(d) Time to travel 24 km upstream?

Given: u = 10 km/hr, v = 2 km/hr  
(a) Ds = u + v = 10 + 2 = 12 km/hr  
(b) Us = u - v = 10 - 2 = 8 km/hr  
(c) Time = 36 / 12 = 3 hours  
(d) Time = 24 / 8 = 3 hours

----------------------------
EXAMPLE 2
----------------------------
A boat travels downstream at 15 km/hr and upstream at 9 km/hr.
Find:
(a) Speed of boat in still water
(b) Speed of stream

(a) u = (15 + 9) / 2 = 12 km/hr  
(b) v = (15 - 9) / 2 = 3 km/hr

----------------------------
TIME RATIO TRICK
----------------------------
If time taken upstream is ‘n’ times the time downstream (same distance):

1 / (u - v) = n / (u + v)  
=> u + v = n(u - v)  
=> u/v = (n + 1) / (n - 1)

Shortcut to get u:v ratio from time ratio.

----------------------------
ROUND TRIP TIME
----------------------------
If distance = D (down + up), total time:

Total Time = D / (u + v) + D / (u - v)

----------------------------
TIPS & REMINDERS
----------------------------
- Always check units: use consistent ones (e.g., km/hr with hours)
- Watch for direction: still water vs upstream vs downstream
- Use the formula wisely based on what’s given
- Visualizing helps: current helps in downstream, resists in upstream
