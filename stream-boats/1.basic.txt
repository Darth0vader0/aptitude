Basic Concepts and Formulas
Speed of Boat in Still Water (u): This is the speed at which the boat would travel if there were no current in the water.

Speed of Stream/Current (v): This is the speed of the water flow.

Downstream Speed (Ds): When the boat travels in the same direction as the stream.

The stream helps the boat, so their speeds add up.
Formula: Ds = u + v
Upstream Speed (Us): When the boat travels in the opposite direction to the stream.

The stream opposes the boat, so the stream's speed is subtracted from the boat's speed.
Formula: Us = u - v
From these two primary formulas, we can derive formulas to find u and v if Ds and Us are known:

Speed of Boat in Still Water (u):

Formula: u = (Ds + Us) / 2
Speed of Stream (v):

Formula: v = (Ds - Us) / 2
And don't forget the fundamental relationship: 7. Distance = Speed × Time * This can be rearranged as: * Time = Distance / Speed * Speed = Distance / Time

Examples
Let's look at a couple of examples to see these formulas in action.

Example 1: A boat's speed in still water is 10 km/hr. The speed of the stream is 2 km/hr. (a) What is the boat's speed downstream? (b) What is the boat's speed upstream? (c) How long will it take to travel 36 km downstream? (d) How long will it take to travel 24 km upstream?

Solution: Given:

Speed of boat in still water (u) = 10 km/hr
Speed of stream (v) = 2 km/hr
(a) Downstream Speed (Ds): Ds = u + v = 10 + 2 = 12 km/hr Ans: 12 km/hr

(b) Upstream Speed (Us): Us = u - v = 10 - 2 = 8 km/hr Ans: 8 km/hr

(c) Time to travel 36 km downstream: Distance = 36 km Speed = Ds = 12 km/hr Time = Distance / Speed = 36 / 12 = 3 hours Ans: 3 hours

(d) Time to travel 24 km upstream: Distance = 24 km Speed = Us = 8 km/hr Time = Distance / Speed = 24 / 8 = 3 hours Ans: 3 hours

Example 2: A boat travels downstream at 15 km/hr and upstream at 9 km/hr. (a) What is the speed of the boat in still water? (b) What is the speed of the stream?

Solution: Given:

Downstream Speed (Ds) = 15 km/hr
Upstream Speed (Us) = 9 km/hr
(a) Speed of boat in still water (u): u = (Ds + Us) / 2 = (15 + 9) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12 km/hr Ans: 12 km/hr

(b) Speed of stream (v): v = (Ds - Us) / 2 = (15 - 9) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 km/hr Ans: 3 km/hr

Some Tricks and Tips
Memorize the Core Formulas: Ds = u + v and Us = u - v are fundamental. The derived formulas u = (Ds + Us) / 2 and v = (Ds - Us) / 2 are extremely useful for quickly finding individual speeds when downstream and upstream speeds are given.

Ratio of Times: If a boat takes 'n' times as long to go upstream as to go downstream for the same distance:

Time upstream = n × Time downstream
Distance / Us = n × (Distance / Ds)
1 / (u - v) = n / (u + v)
u + v = n(u - v)
This can be rearranged to find the ratio of u to v: u/v = (n+1)/(n-1)
This is a handy shortcut if the problem gives you a ratio of times.
Total Time for a Round Trip: If a boat travels a distance 'D' downstream and returns the same distance 'D' upstream, the total time taken is:

Total Time = D/(u+v) + D/(u-v)
Units Consistency: Always ensure that all units (speed, distance, time) are consistent. If speed is in km/hr, distance should be in km, and time in hours. Convert if necessary.

Careful Reading: Pay close attention to whether the given speed is the boat's speed in still water or its speed downstream/upstream. This is a common point of confusion.
