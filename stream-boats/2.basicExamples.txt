   Ans: 5 hours

7. Problem: A boat's speed in still water is 14 km/hr, and the speed of the current is 3 km/hr. How much time will the boat take to cover 55 km upstream?  
   Ans: 5 hours

8. Problem: A man can row downstream at 18 km/hr and upstream at 10 km/hr. Find the time taken to cover 70 km in still water.  
   Ans: 5 hours

9. Problem: The speed of a boat in still water is 7 km/hr, and the speed of the stream is 3 km/hr. If the boat takes 6 hours to travel downstream to a certain point, what is the distance?  
   Ans: 60 km

10. Problem: A boat goes upstream at 5 km/hr. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/hr, how far can the boat travel upstream in 4 hours?  
    Ans: 20 km

11. Problem: A boat's speed in still water is 9 km/hr, and the speed of the stream is 3 km/hr. It goes to a place 24 km downstream and returns to the starting point. Find the total time taken for the entire journey.  
    Ans: 6 hours

12. Problem: A man rows to a place 48 km distant and back in 14 hours. He finds that he can row 4 km with the stream in the same time as 3 km against the stream. Find the rate of the stream.  
    Ans: 1 km/hr

13. Problem: A boat takes twice as long to travel upstream as to travel downstream for the same distance. If the speed of the boat in still water is 12 km/hr, find the speed of the stream.  
    Ans: 4 km/hr

14. Problem: The speed of a boat in still water is 5 times the speed of the current. If the boat travels 120 km downstream in 5 hours, what is the speed of the boat in still water?  
    Ans: 20 km/hr

15. Problem: A boat covers a certain distance downstream in 1 hour, while it comes back upstream in 1.5 hours. If the speed of the stream is 3 km/hr, what is the speed of the boat in still water?  
    Ans: 15 km/hr

16. Problem: A man can row 6 km/hr in still water. If the river is running at 2 km/hr, it takes him 3 hours to row to a place and come back. How far is the place?  
    Ans: 8 km

17. Problem: The speed of a motorboat is that of the current of water as 36:5. The boat goes along with the current in 5 hours 10 minutes. How much time will it take to come back?  
    Ans: 6 hours 50 minutes

18. Problem: A boat running upstream takes 8 hours 48 minutes to cover a certain distance, while it takes 4 hours to cover the same distance running downstream. What is the ratio between the speed of the boat and speed of the water current respectively?  
    Ans: 8:3

19. Problem: If a boat goes 7 km upstream in 42 minutes and the speed of the stream is 3 kmph, then the speed of the boat in still water is:  
    Ans: 13 kmph

20. Problem: A man rows 1 km in 5 minutes along the stream and 6 km in 1 hour against the stream. What is the speed of the stream?  
    Ans: 3 km/hr
