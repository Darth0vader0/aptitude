1. A boat travels 48 km downstream in 3 hours and returns upstream in 5 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream.

2. A man can row to a place 30 km away and back in 9 hours. He finds that he can row 3 km with the stream in the same time as 2 km against the stream. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream.

3. A boat takes 2 hours to travel 24 km downstream and 3 hours to return the same distance upstream. What is the ratio of the boat’s speed to the stream’s speed?

4. A man rows a boat to a place 60 km distant and back. If the stream’s speed is 3 km/hr and the total time taken is 9 hours, find the speed of the man in still water.

5. A motorboat can travel 36 km downstream in 1.5 hours and return upstream in 2.25 hours. Find the speed of the current and the speed of the boat in still water.

6. A boat covers a distance of 72 km downstream and returns upstream in a total of 12 hours. If the speed of the current is 3 km/hr, find the speed of the boat in still water.

7. A boat’s speed in still water is 5 times the speed of the stream. It covers 90 km downstream in 2 hours. Find the speed of the stream.

8. A boat covers 56 km upstream in 7 hours and 56 km downstream in 4 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current.

9. A boat travels from point A to B downstream and returns upstream to point A. The downstream speed is 18 km/hr, upstream speed is 12 km/hr, and total time taken is 6.5 hours. Find the distance between A and B.

10. A boat takes 6 hours to go 60 km downstream and come back the same distance upstream. If the speed of the current is 2 km/hr, find the speed of the boat in still water.

11. A boat takes 5 hours to travel 60 km upstream and 4 hours to travel the same distance downstream. Find the speed of the boat and the speed of the stream.

12. A boat covers 48 km downstream in 3 hours and returns in 4 hours. If the boat’s speed in still water is increased by 25%, how much less time would it take to return upstream?

13. A man rows downstream 48 km in 4 hours. If he rows upstream the same distance in 6 hours, how much time will he take to row 96 km in still water?

14. A boat covers a certain distance downstream in 2.5 hours and returns upstream in 3.75 hours. If the speed of the current is 2.5 km/hr, find the length of the journey.

15. A boat takes 8 hours to travel 80 km downstream and 10 hours to return the same distance upstream. Find the speed of the current and the speed of the boat.

16. A boat travels 24 km downstream in 2 hours and returns upstream in 3 hours. If the boat increases its still water speed by 20%, how much time will it now take to cover 30 km upstream?

17. A motorboat, running upstream, takes twice the time it takes to go the same distance downstream. If the speed of the stream is 4 km/hr and the one-way distance is 36 km, find the speed of the boat in still water.

18. A man rows to a place 42 km away and back in 12 hours. If the speed of the current is 3 km/hr and his speed in still water is 9 km/hr, find the time taken for the downstream journey.

19. A boat can go 72 km downstream in 3 hours. If it returns the same distance in 6 hours, what is the difference between downstream and upstream speeds?

20. A boat takes 2 hours more to go 40 km upstream than to return the same distance downstream. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/hr, find the speed of the boat in still water.
