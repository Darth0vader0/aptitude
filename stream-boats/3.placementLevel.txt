1. A boat takes 4 hours to travel 40 km downstream and 5 hours to travel the same distance upstream. Find the speed of the boat and the speed of the stream.

2. A man can row 18 km downstream in 3 hours and return in 6 hours. What is the speed of the stream?

3. A boat covers a certain distance downstream in 2 hours and returns upstream in 3 hours. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/hr, find the distance.

4. A boat's speed in still water is 15 km/hr. It takes 2 hours to go downstream and 3 hours to return upstream. What is the distance of the journey?

5. A man rows downstream at 18 km/hr and upstream at 12 km/hr. How long will he take to row 60 km in still water?

6. A boat travels 30 km upstream in 5 hours and the same distance downstream in 3 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water.

7. A boat takes 6 hours to go 60 km downstream and 9 hours to return upstream. What is the speed of the stream?

8. A man rows a certain distance upstream and back in 9 hours. If the speed of the current is 3 km/hr and the one-way distance is 36 km, find the man’s speed in still water.

9. A motorboat covers 45 km downstream in 2.5 hours and the same distance upstream in 3.75 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water.

10. A boat takes 2 hours more to cover 40 km upstream than to cover the same distance downstream. If the speed of the current is 2 km/hr, what is the speed of the boat in still water?

11. A man takes 10 hours to row 60 km downstream and back to the starting point. If the speed of the stream is 2.5 km/hr, find the speed of the man in still water.

12. A boat can travel 20 km upstream and 36 km downstream in 7 hours. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/hr, what is the speed of the boat in still water?

13. A man can row 8 km against the stream in 1 hour more than he takes to row 8 km with the stream. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/hr, what is his speed in still water?

14. A boat covers 120 km downstream in 4 hours and the same distance upstream in 6 hours. Find the speed of the stream.

15. A boat’s speed in still water is 16 km/hr. It takes 2.5 hours to go to a place and 3.5 hours to return. Find the speed of the stream.

16. A boat takes 4 hours to go 48 km downstream and 6 hours to come back. What is the speed of the boat in still water?

17. A boat travels from A to B (downstream) in 5 hours and returns in 7 hours. If the speed of the current is 2 km/hr, find the distance between A and B.

18. A boat's speed in still water is 12 km/hr. It takes 4 hours to go 48 km downstream. How long will it take to return the same distance upstream?

19. A man rows downstream 60 km in 3 hours. If he rows the same distance upstream in 5 hours, what is the speed of the stream?

20. A boat takes 10 hours to go 70 km downstream and come back the same distance. If the speed of the current is 2 km/hr, what is the boat’s speed in still water?
