       PIPES AND CISTERNS – BASICS
===============================

1. Inlet Pipe:
   → Fills the tank (adds water)
   → Work done is positive
   → If a pipe fills the tank in X hours, then part filled in 1 hour = 1/X

2. Outlet Pipe:
   → Empties the tank (drains water)
   → Work done is negative
   → If a pipe empties the tank in Y hours, then part emptied in 1 hour = -1/Y

3. Combined Work:
   → If an inlet fills in X hours and an outlet empties in Y hours:
     Net work in 1 hour = (1/X) - (1/Y)
   → If net work is positive → tank is filling
   → If net work is negative → tank is draining

4. Total Time:
   → If net rate = R (in terms of tank per hour), then total time = 1/R

5. If multiple pipes fill the tank:
   → Sum all rates: 1/X + 1/Y + 1/Z …

6. If multiple pipes are opened alternately:
   → Break time into intervals and calculate cumulative effect step by step.

7. If tank has a leak:
   → Work done by leak is considered negative
   → Example: If A fills in 4 hours and leak empties in 6 hours,
     then net rate = (1/4 - 1/6)

8. Full tank volume concept:
   → Assume full tank = 1 unit (or use LCM for volume if needed for convenience)

9. Time taken to fill ‘part’ of the tank:
   → Time = (Required work) / (Net rate)

10. Pipe closed/opened after certain time:
   → Use piecewise calculation (e.g., first X minutes with both, rest with only one)

        KEY FORMULAS
===============================

✓ Time = Work / Rate

✓ Net rate = Sum of inlet pipes – Sum of outlet pipes

✓ If pipe A fills in X hours and pipe B fills in Y hours,
   Together they fill in = (XY)/(X + Y) hours

✓ If
