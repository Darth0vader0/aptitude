RATIO AND PROPORTION â€“ BASICS
===============================

ðŸ”¹ 1. Ratio:
- A ratio is a comparison of two quantities of the same kind using division.
- If a and b are two numbers, then their ratio is written as a : b or a/b.

Examples:
- Ratio of 8 to 4 is 8:4 = 2:1
- Ratio of 2 kg to 500 g = 2000g:500g = 4:1

ðŸ”¹ 2. Properties of Ratio:
- Ratio has no units.
- Ratios must be compared in the same units.
- Multiplying or dividing both terms by the same non-zero number doesnâ€™t change the ratio.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Proportion:
- A proportion states that two ratios are equal.
- a : b = c : d â‡’ a/b = c/d â‡’ ad = bc

Here, a, b, c, d are in proportion.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Continued Proportion:
- If a : b = b : c, then bÂ² = ac
- Then a, b, c are in continued proportion.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Mean and Extreme Terms:
In a : b = c : d,
- a and d are called extremes,
- b and c are called means.

So, product of extremes = product of means â‡’ a Ã— d = b Ã— c

ðŸ”¹ 6. Duplicate, Triplicate and Subduplicate Ratios:
- Duplicate ratio of a : b = aÂ² : bÂ²
- Triplicate ratio of a : b = aÂ³ : bÂ³
- Subduplicate ratio = âˆša : âˆšb

ðŸ”¹ 7. Inverse Ratio:
- Inverse of a : b = b : a

ðŸ”¹ 8. Compound Ratio:
- Compound ratio of a : b and c : d = (a Ã— c) : (b Ã— d)

ðŸ”¹ 9. Ratio of Quantities:
- To compare speeds, weights, ages, amounts, time, prices, etc.

ðŸ”¹ 10. Increase or Decrease in Ratio:
If a quantity is increased or decreased by x%, then:
- New ratio = original Ã— (1 Â± x/100)

APPLICATIONS OF RATIO
========================

âœ… 1. Income and Expenditure
âœ… 2. Mixture and Alligation
âœ… 3. Ages and Time Problems
âœ… 4. Sharing profits in partnership
âœ… 5. Time, Speed and Distance comparisons
âœ… 6. Simplifying complex fractions
âœ… 7. Dividing amounts in a ratio

===========================
Example Shortcuts to Remember:
===========================

1. If a : b = m : n, then:
   - a = m Ã— x, b = n Ã— x for some x
   - Sum = a + b = x(m + n)

2. To divide â‚¹A in ratio m : n â‡’
   - First part = A Ã— m / (m + n)
   - Second part = A Ã— n / (m + n)

3. When two numbers are in ratio a : b and their sum is S:
   - The numbers are (a Ã— S)/(a + b) and (b Ã— S)/(a + b)
