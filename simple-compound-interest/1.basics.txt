Compound and Simple Interest - Basics and Formulas
==================================================

I. SIMPLE INTEREST (SI)
------------------------
1. Formula:
   SI = (P × R × T) / 100

   Where:
   P = Principal amount
   R = Rate of interest per annum (%)
   T = Time (in years)

2. Total Amount (A):
   A = P + SI

3. Example:
   If P = ₹1000, R = 10%, T = 2 years
   SI = (1000 × 10 × 2) / 100 = ₹200
   A = 1000 + 200 = ₹1200

II. COMPOUND INTEREST (CI)
---------------------------
1. Formula (Annual Compounding):
   A = P × (1 + R/100)^T
   CI = A - P

2. Formula (Half-Yearly Compounding):
   A = P × (1 + (R/2)/100)^(2T)

3. Formula (Quarterly Compounding):
   A = P × (1 + (R/4)/100)^(4T)

4. Approximate Shortcut (for 2 years, when R is small):
   CI ≈ SI + (SI × R)/100

5. Example:
   P = ₹1000, R = 10%, T = 2 years

   Annual:
   A = 1000 × (1 + 0.10)^2 = 1000 × 1.21 = ₹1210
   CI = 1210 - 1000 = ₹210

   Half-Yearly:
   A = 1000 × (1 + 0.05)^4 ≈ 1000 × 1.2155 ≈ ₹1215.5
   CI ≈ ₹215.5

   Quarterly:
   A = 1000 × (1 + 0.025)^8 ≈ 1000 × 1.219 ≈ ₹1219
   CI ≈ ₹219

III. Key Points
----------------
- Compound interest always gives more return than simple interest over the same duration.
- For short time or low rate, CI ≈ SI.
- Compound Interest grows exponentially due to interest on interest.
