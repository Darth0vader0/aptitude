CLOCK PROBLEMS – ADVANCED LEVEL (PLACEMENT/COMPETITIVE PRACTICE)

1. At what time between 7 and 8 will the hands of the clock be together?

2. A clock is set at 12:00. After how many minutes will the hands overlap for the first time?

3. At what time between 5 and 6 is the angle between the hands 30°?

4. Find the time between 2 and 3 when the hands are exactly in the same straight line but not overlapping.

5. At what time between 8 and 9 is the angle between the hands 60°?

6. How many times between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. will the hands of the clock form a 90° angle?

7. At what time between 3 and 4 will the minute hand be 15 minutes spaces ahead of the hour hand?

8. Find the time between 1 and 2 when the hands of the clock are 90° apart for the second time.

9. At what time between 11 and 12 will the hands be 60° apart?

10. The minute hand of a clock overtakes the hour hand at intervals of how many minutes?

11. A clock gains 5 minutes every hour. If it is set correctly at 12:00, what time will it show at 3:00 actual time?

12. A clock is 10 minutes slow at 2 p.m. and 20 minutes fast at 8 p.m. When was it correct?

13. At what time between 10 and 11 are the hands 54° apart?

14. At what time between 4 and 5 are the hands at a distance of 18°?

15. A watch gains 2 minutes every 6 hours. If it shows correct time at 6 a.m., what time will it show at 6 p.m.?

16. At what time between 12 and 1 is the angle between the hands 84°?

17. A clock shows the correct time at 5:00. After that, it loses 1 minute every hour. What will be the correct time when it shows 10:00?

18. At what time between 9 and 10 will the hands be at right angle for the second time?

19. At what time between 6 and 7 is the angle between the hour and minute hands 120°?

20. A clock is observed to be 7 minutes fast at 7 a.m. and 5 minutes slow at 7 p.m. When was it correct?
