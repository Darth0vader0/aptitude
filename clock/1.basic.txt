CLOCK APTITUDE - BASIC CONCEPTS AND FORMULAS

-----------------------------------------------
1. Basic Understanding of a Clock
-----------------------------------------------
- A clock has 12 hours marked on its dial.
- The minute hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes.
- The hour hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 12 hours (or 720 minutes).

-----------------------------------------------
2. Movements of Clock Hands
-----------------------------------------------
Minute Hand:
- Moves 360° in 60 minutes => 6° per minute.

Hour Hand:
- Moves 360° in 12 hours => 0.5° per minute.

-----------------------------------------------
3. Angle Between Hour and Minute Hands
-----------------------------------------------
Formula:
    Angle = |(30 × Hours) - (11/2 × Minutes)|

- This formula gives the smaller angle between the two hands.
- Hours should be in 12-hour format.
- Use absolute value to ensure a positive angle.

-----------------------------------------------
4. Right Angle Between the Hands (90 Degrees)
-----------------------------------------------
Condition:
    |(30 × H) - (11/2 × M)| = 90

- Hands are at 90° twice every hour.
- Solve the above equation to find minutes.

-----------------------------------------------
5. Straight Line (180 Degrees) Between Hands
-----------------------------------------------
Condition:
    |(30 × H) - (11/2 × M)| = 180

- Hands form a straight line twice every hour.
- Solve the equation to find time.

-----------------------------------------------
6. Coincidence of Hands (Both Hands Overlap)
-----------------------------------------------
- The hands coincide (overlap) every 65 5/11 minutes.
- In 12 hours, hands coincide 11 times.

Time of first coincidence:
    Minute = (60/11) × Hour

Example:
    At 3 o’clock → Time = (60/11) × 3 = 180/11 minutes = 16 4/11 minutes past 3.

-----------------------------------------------
7. When Hands are Opposite (180° Apart)
-----------------------------------------------
- Happens every 65 5/11 minutes after they overlap.
- Total 11 such instances in 12 hours.

-----------------------------------------------
8. When Hands are at 90° (Right Angle)
-----------------------------------------------
- Happens every 32 8/11 minutes after one another.
- Total 22 times in 12 hours.

-----------------------------------------------
9. When Hands are 0° (Overlap) or 180° (Straight Line)
-----------------------------------------------
- Use angle = 0 or 180 in the base formula:
    Angle = |(30 × H) - (11/2 × M)|

-----------------------------------------------
10. Time Gain/Loss by Clock Hands
-----------------------------------------------
- In every hour, the minute hand gains 5 complete divisions (or 360°) over the hour hand.

-----------------------------------------------
Tip:
- Always keep angles in degrees.
- Convert time into minute fractions when needed.
- For time calculations, prefer using the base formula directly.



CLOCK PROBLEMS – ADVANCED INSIGHTS & FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE

------------------------------------------------------------
1. How Many Times the Hands Coincide (Overlap) in 24 Hours?
------------------------------------------------------------
- In 12 hours, the hour and minute hands coincide **11 times**.
- Therefore, in 24 hours:  
  → 11 × 2 = **22 times**

------------------------------------------------------------
2. How Many Times the Hands are Opposite (180° Apart)?
------------------------------------------------------------
- Hands are in a straight line (180° apart) also **11 times** in 12 hours.
- So in 24 hours:  
  → 11 × 2 = **22 times**

------------------------------------------------------------
3. How Many Times the Hands are at Right Angle (90°)?
------------------------------------------------------------
- Hands are at 90° **twice** in every hour:
  → Once when the minute hand is ahead of the hour hand.
  → Once when the minute hand is behind.

- So, in 12 hours:
  → 2 × 12 = **24 times**
- In 24 hours:
  → 24 × 2 = **48 times**

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary Table:
------------------------------------------------------------
| Situation           | In 12 hours | In 24 hours |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Coincide (0°)       | 11 times    | 22 times    |
| Opposite (180°)     | 11 times    | 22 times    |
| Right Angle (90°)   | 22 times    | 44 times    |

* Note: Some books mention 22 right angles in 12 hours. That’s because it occurs twice in every hour (not on the hour), for a total of 22 *unique* positions.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Why Not 12 Coincidences in 12 Hours?
------------------------------------------------------------
- Because at 12:00 both hands are at the same place.
- The next coincidence happens just before 1:05.
- They do **not** meet exactly 12 times due to the relative motion.
- They meet **every 65 5/11 minutes**, so:
  → 720 minutes / 65 5/11 ≈ 11 coincidences.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. Important Facts to Remember:
------------------------------------------------------------
- Hands meet every 65 5/11 minutes.
- They are 180° apart every 65 5/11 minutes after a coincidence.
- They are 90° apart every 32 8/11 minutes.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. Extra Tip:
------------------------------------------------------------
- Minute hand is faster than the hour hand.
- The minute hand gains 360° over the hour hand in 12 hours.
  → This is why they meet 11 times: 360° / (360°/11) = 11

------------------------------------------------------------
8. Useful Conversions:
------------------------------------------------------------
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 30° for the hour hand (360°/12)
- 1 minute = 6° for the minute hand (360°/60)
- Hour hand moves 0.5° per minute
