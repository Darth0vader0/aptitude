PROBLEMS ON TRAINS – BASICS & FORMULAS
======================================

🚆 Train-Based Problems focus on:
✅ Time, Speed, and Distance
✅ Relative speed when two bodies move
✅ Length of train/platform/object
✅ Conversion between units (km/hr ↔ m/s)

=====================
🔸 BASIC FORMULAS
=====================

1. **Speed = Distance / Time**
2. **Distance = Speed × Time**
3. **Time = Distance / Speed**

👉 Convert km/hr to m/s: multiply by **5/18**  
👉 Convert m/s to km/hr: multiply by **18/5**

=====================
🔸 BASIC CASES
=====================

📌 Case 1: Train passing a pole/person
- Time = Length of train / Speed

📌 Case 2: Train passing a platform (or bridge)
- Time = (Length of train + Length of platform) / Speed

📌 Case 3: Two trains moving in **same direction**
- Relative speed = Difference of their speeds

📌 Case 4: Two trains moving in **opposite direction**
- Relative speed = Sum of their speeds

📌 Case 5: Train overtaking or crossing another moving object (e.g. car, man, train)
- Use relative speed = |S₁ - S₂| if same direction
- Relative speed = S₁ + S₂ if opposite direction

============================
🔸 UNIT CONVERSIONS
============================

1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s  
1 m/s = 18/5 km/hr

Example:
- 90 km/hr = 90 × 5/18 = 25 m/s

===============================
🔸 TYPICAL QUESTION PATTERNS
===============================

1. Train passes a stationary object — find speed or time
2. Train crosses a platform — find length/speed
3. Two trains cross each other (same or opposite direction)
4. A train overtakes a walking man/bike — find speed of train
5. Train crosses a bridge or tunnel
6. Time taken to cross a man running in opposite direction

=========================
🔸 IMPORTANT TIPS
=========================

✔ Always **convert speeds** to m/s when distances are in meters  
✔ Always **add lengths** when object has length (e.g. platform, bridge)  
✔ Use **relative speed** logic when
