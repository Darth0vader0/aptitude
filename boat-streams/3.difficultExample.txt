Boats and Streams â€“ 20 Difficult/Placement-Level Questions 
========================================================================

1. A boat covers 50 km downstream in 2 hours and returns upstream in 5 hours. Find the speed of the stream and the speed of the boat in still water.

2. A man can row 40 km downstream in 4 hours. If he takes 5 hours to return the same distance, find the speed of the stream and of the boat.

3. The speed of a stream is 3 km/h. A boat goes 42 km downstream in 3 hours. Find the time taken to cover 36 km upstream.

4. A boat travels from point A to B downstream and returns upstream in a total of 13 hours. The distance between A and B is 48 km. If the speed of the current is 2 km/h, find the speed of the boat.

5. A boat can travel 28 km upstream and 52 km downstream in 7 hours. If it can travel 30 km upstream and 45 km downstream in 8 hours, find the speed of the boat and stream.

6. A man rows to a place 72 km distant and back in 18 hours. He finds that he can row 5 km with the stream in the same time as 3 km against it. Find the speed of the man in still water and the stream.

7. A boat covers a certain distance downstream in 1 hour less than upstream. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/h and the distance is 36 km, find the speed of the boat in still water.

8. A boat can travel a certain distance downstream in 3 hours and return upstream in 4 hours. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/h, and the total distance covered is 84 km, find the speed of the boat in still water.

9. A boat takes 5 hours to row 30 km upstream and 2 hours to cover the same distance downstream. Find the speed of the stream.

10. A boat takes 12 hours to travel a distance downstream and back upstream. If the downstream speed is twice the upstream speed and the total distance is 90 km, find the speed of the boat in still water.

11. A boat takes 2 hours less to travel 90 km downstream than to travel the same distance upstream. If the speed of the stream is 3 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.

12. A boat covers 36 km upstream and 48 km downstream in 9 hours. It also covers 24 km upstream and 36 km downstream in 6 hours. Find the speed of the boat and stream.

13. A boat travels 60 km downstream and returns to the starting point in 9 hours. If the speed of the boat in still water is 10 km/h, find the speed of the stream.

14. A boat goes 24 km upstream in 3 hours and 36 km downstream in 2 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water and that of the stream.

15. A boat travels from point A to B (upstream) and back in 5 hours. If the river flows at 3 km/h and the distance between A and B is 24 km, find the speed of the boat in still water.

16. A man can row at 6 km/h in still water. If the river is flowing at 2 km/h, it takes him 4 hours to row to a place and back. Find the distance.

17. A boat takes 4 hours more to go 120 km upstream than downstream. If the speed of the stream is 5 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.

18. A boat takes 2 hours to go from A to B downstream and 3 hours to return. If the speed of the boat in still water is 12 km/h, find the speed of the stream and the distance AB.

19. A boat covers a certain distance upstream in 8 hours and the same distance downstream in 6 hours. If the speed of the boat in still water is 14 km/h, find the speed of the stream and the distance.

20. A boat travels 84 km downstream in 4 hours and the same distance upstream in 6 hours. Find the speed of the stream and the speed of the boat in still water.
