Boats and Streams â€“ 20 Basic Practice Questions 
=============================================================

1. A boat can travel 36 km downstream in 3 hours. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.

2. A man can row 18 km downstream in 2 hours and 12 km upstream in 3 hours. Find the speed of the boat and the speed of the stream.

3. If the speed of a boat in still water is 10 km/h and the speed of the current is 3 km/h, how much time will it take to go 39 km downstream?

4. A boat covers 24 km downstream in 2 hours and the same distance upstream in 3 hours. Find the speed of the stream.

5. A man rows 30 km downstream in 2 hours and 18 km upstream in 3 hours. Find the speed of the stream.

6. A boat goes 40 km upstream in 5 hours. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.

7. A boat takes 2 hours to travel 16 km downstream and 4 hours to return. What is the speed of the boat and the stream?

8. A boat can go 36 km upstream and 60 km downstream in 9 hours. If the speed of the stream is 3 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.

9. A boat travels 20 km downstream in 2 hours and returns in 5 hours. Find the speed of the stream.

10. A boat running downstream covers 45 km in 3 hours and running upstream covers the same distance in 5 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water.

11. A motorboat takes 1 hour to go 15 km downstream and returns in 1.5 hours. What is the speed of the stream?

12. A boat can row 12 km downstream in 1.5 hours and 6 km upstream in 1.5 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water.

13. A boat goes 24 km downstream in 3 hours. If the speed of the boat in still water is 8 km/h, find the speed of the stream.

14. A boat takes 6 hours to travel 60 km downstream and 10 hours to travel the same distance upstream. What is the speed of the boat in still water?

15. The speed of a boat in still water is 15 km/h. It can travel 30 km downstream in 1.5 hours. Find the speed of the stream.

16. A man can row 10 km downstream in 60 minutes, but takes 90 minutes to row the same distance upstream. Find the speed of the stream.

17. A boat travels 60 km downstream in 4 hours and 60 km upstream in 6 hours. What is the speed of the stream?

18. A man rows downstream 40 km in 4 hours and upstream 32 km in 4 hours. Find the speed of the man in still water.

19. A boat travels 90 km downstream in 6 hours and 60 km upstream in 6 hours. What is the speed of the stream?

20. A boat takes 3 hours to cover 30 km downstream and 5 hours to cover 30 km upstream. Find the speed of the boat and the stream.
