Boats and Streams – Basics and Formulas
=======================================

1. Key Terms:
-------------
- **Upstream**: When a boat moves against the direction of the stream (i.e., against the current).
- **Downstream**: When a boat moves with the direction of the stream (i.e., with the current).

- Let:
  - **B** = Speed of boat in still water (km/h or m/s)
  - **S** = Speed of stream/current (km/h or m/s)

Then:
- **Downstream Speed = (B + S)**
- **Upstream Speed = (B - S)**

2. Time, Speed and Distance:
----------------------------
- **Time = Distance / Speed**
- Use downstream or upstream speed accordingly based on direction.

3. Important Formulas:
----------------------

- **Speed of boat in still water**  
  = (Downstream Speed + Upstream Speed) / 2

- **Speed of stream**  
  = (Downstream Speed – Upstream Speed) / 2

- If time taken for same distance downstream and upstream is different:
  - Let **d = distance**  
  - Then:  
    `d / (B - S) + d / (B + S) = Total Time`

- For equal distances covered upstream and downstream:
  - **Average speed** = (2 × Upstream Speed × Downstream Speed) / (Upstream Speed + Downstream Speed)

4. Unit Conversions:
--------------------
- If speed is in km/h and distance is in meters, convert:
  - 1 km = 1000 meters
  - 1 hour = 3600 seconds

- **To convert km/h to m/s**, multiply by **5/18**

5. Notes:
---------
- Stream speed always **adds to** boat speed downstream, and **subtracts from** boat speed upstream.
- If no stream or river, downstream = upstream = speed of boat in still water.

6. Common Question Types:
-------------------------
- Find speed of boat/stream
- Find distance traveled
- Find time taken in upstream/downstream journey
- Compare times of round trips
- Boats crossing each other or floating objects
